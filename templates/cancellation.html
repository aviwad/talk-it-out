      <h4 class="thickfont text-center">Medical Self Declaration</h4>

      <p>Trips organized by Deyor Camps take place in remote and less-developed regions, with less means of rapid evacuation, medical supplies and facilities. In the event of an accident, illness and/or injury an evacuation will be slow and uncertain as these trips take place in mountainous, high altitude, or other hazardous terrain. Common and uncommon signs and symptoms of altitude sickness should be expected. These include, but are not limited to: sleeplessness, coughing, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and muscle cramps. Severe cases of altitude sickness can include pulmonary and/or cerebral edema. In addition, exposure to microorganisms unknown to our digestive system may cause symptoms from a wide array of gastrointestinal disorders despite the best efforts to treat drinking water and prepare food properly. A poor state of health can greatly increase the dangers and risks that can be incurred on these trips. Therefore, Deyor Camps require that all guests are examined by a physician and are properly immunized for the destination(s). We also require each of our traveler to carry the medical certificate duly completed by a doctor, with them for their trip.<p>
